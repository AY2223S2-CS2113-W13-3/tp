# User Guide

## Introduction

Food Supply Tracker (FSP) is a desktop app for managing food supplies, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FSP can get your food management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Adds a food product to the list of food items.

Format: `add -n FOOD_NAME -e DD/MM/YYYY {-c CAT -q QUANTITY -u UNITS}`

* `-n FOOD_NAME` and `-e DD/MM/YYYY` are compulsory.

Any other unit or no unit added will be deemed as `unit`.
